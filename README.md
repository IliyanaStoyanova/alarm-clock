# Alarm Clock

## This is website for set the alarm.

### I use on the website:

- _Javascript_<br/>
- _HTML_<br/>
- _CSS_<br/>
- _Bootstrap_<br/>

**What's the idea?** <br/>
The website is where you can set up your alarm.
Once the time is up, you will hear a ringtone and you can stop it by pressing Reset Alarm.

**Website features:**

- Select hour and minutes / 24 hours;
- Validate your choice;
- Alarm setting button;
- Alarm reset button.
